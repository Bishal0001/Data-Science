'''Explanation'''

np.vsplit(), np.hsplit(), np.split() will give ValueError if the size of the buckets are unequal unless the indices of partition are already given.
For example in the question's code, we have defined the indices of the rows before which the arrays are cut row-wise.

np.hsplit() divides the arrays horizontally (axis=0) which is not required here.

np.array_split() divides the array into the given number of divisions no matter whether they are equal or not.

np.array_split() divides the array into the given number of divisions no matter whether they are equal or not. But the catch here is that if the 
sizes of divisions are not equal, first division will have different size, therefore if we want the last division to have different size rather 
than first, we will have to pass an array of indices

'''Sample Code'''

m = 11
n = 10
X = np.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=(m,n)).astype(np.float64)
b=2  #no. of buckets
buckets = np.vsplit(X, [(m//b)*i for i in range(1,b)])
# Compute the mean within each bucket
b_means = [np.mean(x, axis=0) for x in buckets]
# Compute the median-of-means
median = np.median(np.array(b_means), axis=0)
print(median) #(n,) shaped array
